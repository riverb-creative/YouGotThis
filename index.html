            <h3>Let's start with introducing yourself!</em></h3>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is River and I use they/them pronouns. I've always been interested in technology, and I have always helped others with technology assitance.
                
            </p>

            <h3>Why did you decide to do a website?</h3>

            <p>I wanted to create a webpage through Github for the <em>'You Got This'</em> One-Pager. <br>
                <br> I'm currently pursuing Full Stack Web Development at Clackamas Community College 
                where I have been gaining knowledge about <br> Adobe Suite, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                PHP, MySQL, WordPress, and a little bit of Python.
                
                <br><br>

                I'm also knowledgable in Microsoft Suite, Google Workspace, and Data Entry

                <br><br>

                I thought I could share my adidas one pager as a webpage since that is what I am eager to learn more about while 
                in college and my intership.

            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Why do <em>'You Got This?'</em></h3>
            <p>
                Since I started the Full Stack Web Development program, I have been adament on creating a more accessible world. Having accessibility
                in the digital world we live in, is an important aspect to provide to everyone.
                
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                Unfortunately, accessibility is an afterthought to many creators in multitude of products that are targeted to the general
                consumer. <em><q>Disabled</q></em> in today's world has a negative connotation, while asking for accessibility is seen as a 
                <em><q>weakness.</q></em> I want to change the thought process of how individuals view these words. I often use a screen-reader 
                because it helps me to listen and read at the same time. We should be viewing accessibility as convenient; what if a person 
                just doesn't want to read this webpage? This individual could use a screen-reader embedded into this webpage.  
            </p>
            <section>
                <p>The amount of vast ideas I have for accessible platforms that could be created for anyone to use are endless. 
                    Here are some of my accessibility ideas:
                </p>


                <ul>
                    <li>Create an embedded text-to-speech reader</li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li>Multiple options of different ways to display words such as:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dyslexie</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Bionic Reading</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Different embedded website themes:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dark Themes</li>
                            <li>Light Themes</li>
                            <li>High Contrast Themes</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <h3>Why Adidas?</h3>
            <p>
                I want my values and the company's values that I work for to align, and with the values that 
                Adidas holds, I believe we would make great changes together. 
                <br><br>
                The way Adidas celebrates diversity and uniqueness is one of the main reasons I would enjoy working at the 
                company. I believe it's an important aspect to include various backgrounds to create something good. Working in a team of 
                diversity will truly change how others think and collaborate together. This is due to all the inputs from every individual who has come from 
                different backgrounds in order to create a great user experience
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Art Projects:</h3>

            <p>Here are some art projects I have worked on in my first two art classes. I was able to learn Adobe Suite, which has greatly helped
                me understand how to create art for websites that I might design for a client. 
            </p>
