            <h2>Welcome to my static HTML page!</h2>
            
            <h3>Why did you decide to do a website&quest;</h3>

            <p>I wanted to create a webpage through Github for the <em>'You Got This'</em> One Pager. 
                <br>I'm currently pursuing Full Stack Web Development at Clackamas Community College 
                where I have been gaining knowledge about Adobe Suite&comma; HTML&comma; CSS&comma; JavaScript&comma;
                <br>PHP&comma; MySQL&comma; WordPress&comma; and a little bit of Python
            </p>
            
            <p>I thought I could share my adidas one pager as a webpage since that is what I am eager to learn more about while 
                in college and my intership&period;
            </p>

            <h3>Why do <em><q>You Got This&quest;</q></em></h3>
            <p>
                Since I started the Full Stack Web Development program, I have been adament on creating a more accessible world. Having accessibility
                in the digital world we live in, is an important aspect to provide to everyone.&period;
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, accessibility is an afterthought to many creators in multitude of products that are targeted to the general
                consumer. <q>Disabled</q> in today's world has a negative connotation, while asking for accessibility is seen as a 
                <q>weakness.</q> I want to change the thought process of how individuals view these words. I often use a screen-reader 
                because it helps me to listen and read at the same time. We should be viewing accessibility as convenient; what if a person 
                just doesn't want to read this webpage? This individual could use a screen-reader embedded into this webpage.  
            </p>

            <p>The amount of vast ideas I have for accessible platforms that could be created for anyone to use are endless.</p>

            <h4>Accessibility Ideas:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Create an embedded text-to-speech reader</li>
                <li>Multiple options of different ways to display words such as:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dyslexie</li>
                        <li>Bionic Reading</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Different embedded website themes:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dark Themes</li>
                        <li>Light Themes</li>
                        <li>High Contrast Themes</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        </main>
